## Description
A study and research project based on the topic: User Privacy Implications of DNS Fingerprinting. In this study, we assume the role of an attacker and aim to make use of machine learning techniques to predict websites visited by unsuspecting users.

In this repo, we provide the report of our work.

Due to ethical reasons imposed by our university, we cannot provide the entire source code. However, we hope to probably provide code snippets of certain components of the project soon.
